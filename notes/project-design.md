## Project Overview 
Bookmargins is a bookclub management app that allows readers to easily join bookclubs and track their reading progress. 
### Background 
We (Lizette and Mariko) have started a book club called bookmargins which inspired the idea to create a web app that helps readers manage and engage with their book clubs. 
### Goal 
Create a web app that allows users to manage bookclubs.


## Requirements
### Domain Specific Definitions 
* **Book club**: One or more people reading a book simultaneously, with the intent to discuss the book either at specific milestones throughout the book or once the book has been finished 
* **Owner**: An individual who makes, organizes, and runs a book club.

3. As a reader, I want to view information about my book clubs, such as meeting dates and the book they're currently reading.
