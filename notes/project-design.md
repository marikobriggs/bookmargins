# Project Design 

## Project Overview 
Bookmargins is a bookclub management app that allows readers to easily join bookclubs and track their reading progress. 
### Background 
We (Lizette and Mariko) have started a book club called bookmargins, which inspired the idea to create a web app that helps readers manage and engage with their book clubs. 
### Goal 
Create a web app that allows users to manage bookclubs (create and join).
